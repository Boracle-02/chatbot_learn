Hello, this is a testing chatbot where I utilize google's speech recognition library to have a chatbot that you can try and converse with.

I am using python version 3.9 and I believe this needs be in at least python 3.6 to run properly

Also make sure you have: gTTS, transformers, playsound, and tensorflo installed or it will not run properly. 

Make sure playsound is version 1.2.2.
You can do this with this line in the terminal: pip install playsound==1.2.2
If you already have a newer version of playsound, run: pip uninstall playsound
and follow the directions to properly uninstall it.

Warning: When running the application for the first time, you may be forced to download the data that has been used to train the prebuilt training model that I use.
It is from HuggingFace and its size approximately 1.4G.
