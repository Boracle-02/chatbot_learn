Hello, this is a testing chatbot where I utilize google's speech recognition library to have a chatbot that you can try and converse with.

I am using python version 3.9 and I believe this needs be in at least python 3.6 to run properly
Also make sure you have: SpeechRecognition, gTTS, transformers, and tensorflo installed or it will not run properly.
